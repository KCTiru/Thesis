# üß† Smart Aquatic Monitoring System  
### Real-Time Water Quality & Fish Behavior Analysis Using Raspberry Pi, KNN, CNN, and Self-Hosted Supabase

---

## üìò Overview

This project implements a **hybrid monitoring system** that integrates:
- üå°Ô∏è **Sensor-based KNN classification** for detecting water quality anomalies, and  
- üé• **CNN-based image analysis** for observing fish behavior,  
all coordinated through a **self-hosted Supabase** backend running on Docker.

The system is designed to be **fully reproducible and open-source**, serving as a **research legacy** for future students, developers, or thesis teams to build upon.

# ‚öôÔ∏è System Setup Guide

This section explains how to **set up and run the entire system** ‚Äî from the self-hosted Supabase backend, to the Raspberry Pi scripts, and the CNN Docker container.  
Everything runs **locally** and is designed for **reproducible research** or thesis continuation.
